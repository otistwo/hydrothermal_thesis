# hydrothermal_thesis
Script and data used for my PhD at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) and associated publications. Comprised of three chapters:

1. presence_absence: uses R (rmarkdown) to analyse binary distribution data of vent-associated species across Northwest Pacific. Comprised primarily of network analyses using 'igraph' and multivariate analysis using 'vegan' and other packages.
2. PARCELS: usus Python (jupyter notebook) and methods from 'Ocean PARCELS' to simulate the dispersal of vent-associated larvae among hydrothermal vents of the Northwest Pacific
